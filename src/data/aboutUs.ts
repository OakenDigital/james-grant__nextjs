  pageBody: `<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>James Grant Custom Homes is proud to guide you through one of the most significant decisions of your life. What distinguishes us from other builders is our unparalleled customer service and hands-on approach. When you choose us, you’ll work directly with a family of homebuilding experts, who have been building homes in the Dallas-Fort Worth area for over 30 years. We are on-site regularly throughout the construction process, and you’re welcome to visit the site anytime.</p>

<p>We build fewer than 10 homes a year, allowing us to maintain complete quality control over each project. While we work with trusted subcontractors for various phases, they are always the same team, ensuring consistent and high-quality results.</p>

<p>While other builders may come and go, we’ve consistently exceeded expectations in quality and customer satisfaction. We know that building a new home is a huge decision, so we strive to instill confidence in our clients through our transparent business practices and company stability. We’re happy to provide references from our suppliers, subcontractors, and previous clients upon request. Integrity, attention to detail, and exceptional customer service are the cornerstones of our success.</p>

<p>Whether you’re looking to custom build your dream home or select from one of our existing plans, we’re here to help. Browse our site to see examples of what we can build for you. If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to <a href="/contact">call, text, or email us</a>.</p>`,
